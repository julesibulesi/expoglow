# expoglow
A more organic glow than Nuke's built-in filter.

Simple setup of blur nodes with exponentially increasing size, added back to the input successively. expoglow features a pre- and post-grade section, colour shift settings and a mask input that behaves the way it should â€“ masking the input, not the glow itself.

Should work in all versions and across OS, please let me know if it doesn't.

There is no callback on the mask input. If you want to use a mask, you'll have to manually activaty the mask channel via the checkbox.
